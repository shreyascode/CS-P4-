        <p> On my summer vacation I had come to Khana Shanti Vanam to stay there and meet Daaji. The whole Ashram was filled greener, there was no pollution, peace and a lot of friend. i had also made many new friend like Charith, Sridhar, etc. After some days while I was going back to Kolkata I wanted to stay here more time but unfortunately my school had started.  </p>
